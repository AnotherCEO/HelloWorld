This is my first repository, as a test.

I'm LOOKING FOR CODING PARTNER(S) to help develop a new tech company. I have several ideas for apps and websites which I'm just not sophisticated enough to develop on my own. I'm looking for a partner who is interested in helping me develop one of these ideas. I'm looking for a sweat equity partner (no upfront payment). Here's what I bring to the table:
- I have a mailing list of 13,000 people, which I can increase to 20,000 if need be.
- I will cover all hard costs (servers, storage, etc.)
- I can take care of art and graphics, and have a strong background in design, photoshop, Adobe products, etc.
- Any profits from the website, we'll split 50/50.

DM me for questions and details. Test test.
